20' Gaff Sloop — Sail Construction & Plan
-----------------------------------------

Overview & design intent
- Purpose: classic-daysailer / day-cruiser with traditional gaff appearance, easy reefing and straightforward home sailmaking using Dacron.
- Target sail area: 300–330 ft² to balance handling and performance on a 20' hull.

Rig & nominal dimensions (defaults)
- LOA: 20' (6.10 m)
- Nominal beam: 6.5' (1.98 m)
- Target sail area: ~310 ft² (28.8 m²)
- Mainsail (approx): 225 ft² (20.9 m²)
- Jib (approx): 85 ft² (7.9 m²)

Nominal rig dimensions (use these as the default sizing for the patterns)
- I (foretriangle height, deck to forestay attachment at masthead): 22.0 ft (6.71 m)
- J (foretriangle base, deck to forestay at stem): 7.5 ft (2.29 m)
- P (distance from boom to throat — mainsail luff length): 17.5 ft (5.33 m)
- E (boom length, mainsail foot): 12.0 ft (3.66 m)
- G (length of gaff along its centerline from throat to peak): 8.0 ft (2.44 m)
- Head height above throat (gaff projection): ~6.0 ft (1.83 m)
- Note: These are recommended defaults. For a different mast height/mast position, re-scale the patterns accordingly before cutting.

Printing & verification:
1. Print one sample page at 100% (no “fit to page”). Measure the verification box or a known dimension (100 mm line) to confirm scale.
2. Use 20 mm overlap to tape sheets precisely. Trim margins as needed.
3. Transfer pattern to sailcloth and verify seam matches before final cutting.

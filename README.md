# 20' Classic Gaff Sloop — Open Sail Plan (CC0)

Summary
- Vessel: 20' LOA classic daysailer (Class J-inspired aesthetic).
- Rig: Gaff-headed sloop (single mast, gaff mainsail + jib on forestay).
- Spars: Carbon-fiber spars (mast, gaff, boom) — user-supplied / custom fittings.
- Sailcloth: Dacron (recommended: 6.6 oz/yd² cruising Dacron).
- Reefing: Two reef points on the mainsail (default), reef points in jib optional.
- Battens: 3 full battens in the mainsail (default).
- License: CC0 1.0 Universal (public domain dedication). See LICENSE file.

What’s included
- SAIL_PLAN.md — full construction and sail plan, panel layouts, reinforcement, sewing specs, battens, reefing.
- BOM.md — bill of materials, cloth yardage estimate, hardware list, recommended sizes.
- MAINSAIL_pattern.svg — starter SVG pattern for mainsail (panels indicated & dimensions).
- JIB_pattern.svg — starter SVG pattern for jib (panels indicated & dimensions).
- LICENSE.md — CC0 1.0 Universal.

Assumptions & defaults used
- LOA: 20 ft. Nominal beam: 6.5 ft. Sail area target: 300–330 ft² (mainsail ~220–230 ft², jib ~70–100 ft²).
- Mast step, chainplate and rigging geometry not provided — the plan assumes a standard mast/forestay geometry with forestay intersection ~ at the masthead for the foretriangle height used in the plan. If you supply precise mast step location, chainplate heights or desired mast height, I will re-run the panel layout to match exactly.
- Hull material: you chose Hull D ("something else"). Sail plan is hull-agnostic but sized to the dimensions above. Ensure hull stability and ballast suit the sail area.

Next steps
- If you want tiled 1:1 printable PDFs (A4 or Letter) or DXF files for CNC cutting, tell me which paper/units and I’ll export tiled cut-ready files.
- If you want spars sized and fitting details (carbon tube sizes, wall thicknesses, butt fittings), tell me desired target displacement and performance (cruiser vs racer) and I can produce recommended spar specs and fitting drawings.
